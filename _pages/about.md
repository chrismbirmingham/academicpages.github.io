I am a PhD student in Maja Mataric's [Interaction Lab](http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/) at the University of Southern California. I am interested in exploring the ways we can use robots to improve the lives of everyone, but particularly those living with a disability. I currently focus on understanding multi-party interaction between groups of people and a robot. You can read more about this work [here](http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/projects/desc2.php?name=multiparty_support).

Current Work
======
I am funded on the NSF [Expeditions in Computing](http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/sponsors/desc.php?name=expeditions) Grant for Socially Assistive Robotics for Children. For this grant I support the deployement of Kiwi the Robot to the homes of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.  

I have also begun work on exploring the ability of a robot to facilitate trust between strangers. More details on this work will be forthcoming soon.

Personal Info
======
I graduated from Gonzaga University with a degree in Electrical Engineering and from the University of Bristol with a Masters in Research in Robotics and Autonomous Systems.
